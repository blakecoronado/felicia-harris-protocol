= SPEC-001: The Felicia Harris Protocol
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The Felicia Harris Protocol was developed in response to the catastrophic systemic neglect of Felicia Harris—a disabled, non-verbal, post-stroke, epileptic Black woman—who was repeatedly denied access to emergency services and housing support despite visible medical and legal needs. Her crisis, and the tireless advocacy that followed, revealed massive gaps in accountability, crisis intervention, housing justice, legal access, caregiver support, and policy responsiveness.

This protocol is grounded in the lived experiences of survivors and advocates and formalizes a replicable model for community-driven crisis intervention, systemic accountability, and structural reform. It is named to honor Felicia and to ensure that no one facing similar barriers remains invisible or unprotected.

- Advocacy for caregivers without compensation
- Survivor-centered storytelling tools for communication disabilities

=== Should Have
- Public databases of failing agencies and landlords
- Interactive policy dashboard or map
- Pre-filled legal templates for small claims and complaints
- On-call media/legal advocacy liaisons

=== Could Have
- Annual recognitions for whistleblowers
- Volunteer training modules for caregiver support and ADA education

This unit manages incoming crisis reports when systems like 988, 211, or APS fail to respond. It combines digital intake with human follow-up:

*Technical Components*
- **Hotline Form**: Accessible intake form (mobile-first) for reporting non-response.
- **Case Triage API**: Receives form data and routes to either human advocates or automated alerts.
- **Case Database**: Stores all case metadata including agency contacted, timestamp, location, urgency score.
- **Escalation Dashboard**: Admin view to sort cases by urgency, trigger email/media/legal escalations.

*Data Schema Example*
- `case_id` (UUID)
- `submitted_by` (email or anon)
- `subject_name` (optional)
- `agency_failed` (string)
- `incident_time` (datetime)
- `disability_flag` (boolean)
- `urgency_score` (int, 1–5)
- `advocate_assigned` (user ID)

*Human Roles*
- **On-call advocate**: Gets SMS/email when a high-urgency case is submitted.
- **Escalation team**: Trained media/legal outreach staff.

*Recommended Tools*
- Airtable or Supabase (for case database)
- Formspree or Tally.so (for form intake)
- Twilio (for SMS to on-call advocate)
- Zapier or n8n (to automate routing/escalation)
