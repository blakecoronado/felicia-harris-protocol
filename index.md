# The Felicia Harris Protocol

_A survivor-led model for disability justice, housing rights, legal advocacy, and systemic reform._

This protocol was born from lived crisis, sustained advocacy, and systemic neglect. It honors the life and struggle of Felicia Harris‚Äîa non-verbal, post-stroke, epileptic Black woman repeatedly denied basic support‚Äîand formalizes the system her advocates had to build in response.
